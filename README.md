# My Story

Welcome to my personal portfolio page! This project is a showcase of my skills and is constantly evolving as I learn and grow in the field of front-end development.

## Description

The current version of the site has undergone an upgrade from a vanilla JavaScript prototype, and now features a responsive design with coordinated animation effects. I used Next.js, Chakra UI, and Framer Motion to build this version.

## Next step

Moving forward, I plan to update the site with more information about my latest practice projects to provide a more comprehensive overview of my abilities.

## Thank you

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project! As I continue to refine my front-end skills, I plan to update the site with more projects and content. In the meantime, please feel free to explore my work and get in touch with any feedback or suggestions you may have. Thanks!
